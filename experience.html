                Mayank Gaur is a seasoned finance executive and <strong>DIFC Authorized CFO</strong> with a career defined by the rigorous stewardship of regulated capital and the strategic transformation of global financial operations. Currently serving as the <strong>Head of Finance & Accounts</strong> for a regulated investment fund, Mayank oversees an Asset Under Management (AUM) exceeding <strong>AED 600 Million</strong>, specializing in high-growth Real Estate and Infrastructure assets.
            </p>

            <p class="bio-text">
                At the core of Mayank’s leadership is a dual mandate: ensuring uncompromising governance under strict <strong>DFSA regulations</strong> while driving the financial agility required for aggressive market acquisition. He commands the end-to-end financial lifecycle of the fund, from the precision of <strong>Net Asset Value (NAV)</strong> validation and SPV management to the complexity of liquidity planning and treasury functions. Acting as a strategic partner to investment teams, Mayank evaluates acquisition targets and development budgets, ensuring that every capital deployment is backed by robust internal controls and deep financial foresight.
            </p>

            <p class="bio-text">
                Prior to his current role, Mayank demonstrated his capacity for global scale as a <strong>Group Financial Controller</strong> for a multinational consulting firm. Steering finance operations across the <strong>US, UK, France, and India</strong>, he led a team of 15 professionals through a period of significant modernization. He spearheaded the implementation of <strong>Microsoft Dynamics 365 ERP</strong>, a move that revolutionized the firm's reporting efficiency. His tenure was marked by tangible bottom-line impact: he improved <strong>EBITDA by 10%</strong> through disciplined cost controls, slashed Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) from <strong>90 to 45 days</strong>, and successfully executed corporate restructuring and ESOP frameworks. His vigilance in governance also led to the uncovering and resolution of critical financial irregularities through forensic-level fraud investigation.
            </p>

            <p class="bio-text">
                Mayank’s expertise is deeply rooted in the heavy infrastructure and renewable energy sectors. He has managed financials for a renewable energy portfolio with a massive capacity of <strong>8GW</strong>, securing vital project financing from national and international lenders. His experience extends to managing the P&L for EPC companies and overseeing Transmission & Distribution projects valued at over <strong>INR 1,500 Crores</strong>. During this period, his negotiation skills secured additional claims worth <strong>INR 40 Crores</strong>, while his performance management systems boosted project profitability by <strong>8%</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="bio-text">
                Mayank began his career as a Partner in a CA firm, providing high-level advisory and tax planning to C-suite executives. This foundational experience in complex compliance and strategic advisory continues to inform his approach today. Whether navigating cross-border tax laws, structuring multi-million dollar funds, or optimizing working capital, Mayank Gaur combines the precision of a regulator with the vision of a growth strategist.
